# Weather-Detector-Web-app
This is a web app on which you can find about the weather and cordinates of a city in the whole world (note: This app is still under process)
This app is made entirely using html, css, and python django and openweather.org weather api.
The online live version of this web app will very soon be available on my personal website https://the-mirs-mechatronics.blogspot.com
Stay in touch and dont miss the fun.
